This Program is designed to be used by a customer service site. Customers can submit work orders (incidents) and will be entered into a finite state machine that manages the status of the incident. Service Groups will be assigned by the FSM to help the customer with their issue. Incidents have a state of 'New' when they are created by the customer, 'In Progress' if their is someone assigned to resolve it, 'On Hold' if the incident is put on hold, 'Canceled' if the incident was canceled by the customer, or 'Resolved if the servicer was able to fix the issue for the customer.
